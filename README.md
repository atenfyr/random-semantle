# random-semantle
This is a webpage I made in five minutes that automatically redirects you to [the Semantle webpage](https://semantle.novalis.org/) with a random puzzle.

## Where do I go?
https://atenfyr.github.io/random-semantle/

## How?
This uses Semantle's "custom puzzle" feature to create a custom puzzle with a random word from the game's word bank when the page is loaded.

## Why?
Why not? Just don't get yourself burnt out ;)
